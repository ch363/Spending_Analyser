# Spending Analyser

Scaffold for a Streamlit-based personal finance dashboard. Build features that ingest transaction data, classify spending, detect recurring payments, surface anomalies, and summarize monthly trends.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a Python 3.11+ virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt` once populated.
3. Launch the Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py` after implementing the UI and backend helpers.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit entry point for the user interface.
- `data/seed.csv` — Optional seed dataset for bootstrapping development and demos.
- `lib/` — Library modules for synthetic data, categorization, recurring detection, forecasting, and summarization.
- `prompts/monthly_summary.txt` — Prompt template for LLM-powered summary generation.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependency manifest.

## Next Steps

- Replace placeholder comments with real implementations in each module.
- Populate `requirements.txt` with the libraries you adopt.
- Document architectural decisions and workflows as they evolve.
